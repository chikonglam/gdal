    of TIFF related C functions have been dropped:
       TIFFFindFieldInfo
       TIFFFindFieldInfoByName

gdal (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, with a bounce of bugs fixing.
  * [PATCH] Added gdal-grass.dpatch to add VERSION to the grass plugin
    tarball. This is useful to force failing when a binNMU happens while
    GDAL is transitioning to a major version. See gdal-grass package to
    understand  how it is managed. This trick does allow a proper fix
    of #544978.

  * Patch hdf5.dpatch renamed into hdf4.dpatch, sorry.

  The "doing-it-yourself-is-better" release.

  * New upstream release.
    (closes: #370441)
    As stated previously, changed package name for
    a smooth C++ transition in case of (undocumented) API/ABI changes.
    Changed control and other files as consequence for 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 transition.
    - Patch revised:
    	libname.dpatch
    - Patches removed:
        351372_mipsel_ftbfs.dpatch (applied upstream)
        357189_gcc4.1_ftbfs.dpatch (idem)
        360389_amd64_ftbfs.dpatch  (better done by upstream)
    - New patch:
    	ogrili2layer.cpp.dpatch (gcc 4.1 STL compatibility)
  * Policy bumped to 3.7.2. No changes.
  * Removed a couple of old *.docs and *.files files in debian dir.
  * Added mysql support.
  * Moved to new python policy. Note that python-gdal provides both modules
    and an extension, so quite a few changes are required all around.
    See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPython/NewPolicy for information about
    the matter.

gdal (1.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Add Francesco Paolo Lovergine as uploader, to make sure the next
    upload isn't seen as a non-maintainer upload.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Missed patched reverting, anyway moving to dpatch which is more robust for
    patch management in case of build failures and re-builds.
    (closes: #349562). Changed control and rules files as consequence.

gdal (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Steve Halasz ]
  * Switch to team maintenance by the Debian GIS Project.
    This is _not_ hijacking, Silke is no more active on this package
    and passed the package to the team.
  * New upstream release
    - Don't crash on shapefiles without features (Closes: #309165)
  * Build-dep on libpq-dev | postgresql-dev for postgresql transition
  * Remove build-dep on postgresql-client
  * Make libgdal-dev depend on a number of -dev packages so that
    packages depending on libgdal-dev don't have to depend on them
  * Change library package names to libgdal1-1.3.1 / libgdal1-1.3.1-dev
    to reflect C++ ABI change that will be expected with every new
    version. The C API is stable (SONAME 1), but unfortunately both
    C and C++ API are merged in the same library by upstream.
    See http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-grass-general/2005-December/001565.html
    for a few details about the C++ API and ABI saga.

  [ Paul Wise ]
  * Add homepages to the package descriptions

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Added 02_libname.patch to add the version to the lib name. This will
    allow cohexistence of more version of the library without glitches.

gdal (1.2.6-1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

    Closes: #339163.
  * Build-depend on libgeos-dev (>= 2.1.4-2) to get the matching ABI.
