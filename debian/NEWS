gdal (1.5.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

   GDAL deprecated the old-style python binding starting from 1.5 branch, so
   it has been dropped in Debian. Generally you should not experience big
   problems because almost all API are supported by the current Swig-based
   binding. If not, consider that you need to upgrade to the current binding.

   The old bindings use old Numeric, the new SWIG-based use NumPy, for all
   the rest refer to GDAL documentationi, please.
