gdal (1.5.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

   GDAL deprecated the old-style Python binding starting from 1.5 branch, so
   it has been dropped in Debian. Generally you should not experience big
   problems, because almost all API functions are supported by the new
   Swig-based binding. If not, consider that you need to upgrade to the 
   current interface.
   The old bindings use Numeric, the new SWIG-based use NumPy, for all
   the rest refer to GDAL documentation.
