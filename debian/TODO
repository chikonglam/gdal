Debian maintainers TODO list
----------------------------

* C# binding needs probably to be investigated. It is currently not too stabilized.
  Tcl/Tk binding could be also considered as external project, but its status needs
  to be checked as well. I would avoid both PHP and Java bindings because not yet
  mature.
