  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Reintroducing libgdal1-dev as a transitional package to allow r-deps
    to build in any environment.
  * Removed old dependency on libcurl3-dev for libgdal-dev and added a 
    preferred dep on libcurl4-gnutls-dev to make lintian happy.
  * Added build-{arch|indep} targets in debian/rules.
  * Fixed a bit debian/changelog for latest changes. 
  * Now using libxerces-c-dev as dependency for current library version.

gdal (1.9.0-1~exp5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a build-dep on liburiparser-dev to satisfy configure test. Without
    that GDAL reverts to the old KML support anyway :-(.
  * Explicitly enabled Armadillo and LZMA supports.
  * OpenJPEG is enabled in debian/rules, but still unsupported because current
    library is obsolete. GDAL requires at least 1.4.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon, 05 Mar 2012 17:44:59 +0100

gdal (1.9.0-1~exp4) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New tool: gdalsrsinfo.
  * Dropped patch epsilon.
  * All patches refreshed for current version.
  * Regenerating all symfiles from scratch. But for the usual stock of
    internal C++ changes (with both adding and removing of methods) a couple
    of TIFF related C functions have been dropped:
       TIFFFindFieldInfo
       TIFFFindFieldInfoByName
    which is due to Tiff/GeoTiff resyncing against upstream. This is ignored,
    but we already introduced a SONAME change, and it will not impact sid
    builds and library use.
  * Removed superfluous break/replaces against libgdal1-<version> package.

    specific versioned naming scheme for the library. 
    Dropped patch: libname, python.
  * Added sparc and mipsel symbol files.
  * Updated NEWS file with basic information about changes in the package.
  * Removed now obsolete libtool build-dep.
    (closes: #639887)

gdal (1.8.1-2~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Introduced per arch symbol files with demangled C++ symbols.
    They are all included by the main symbol file after the C symbols.
    Provided archs: amd64, armel, i386, ia64, mips, powerpc and s390.

  [ Aron Xu ]
  * Really use libjpeg-dev to allow transition.
    (Closes: #629964)
  * Build-Depends on libpng-dev instead of libpng12-dev.
  * Transition to dh_python2. (Closes: #616821)

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * New upstream release with fixes for 1.8 series.
    (closes: #636053, #638073)
  * Revised for migration to dh_python2.
    (closes: #616821)
  * Merged lintian-overrides handling from 1.7 branch.
  * This version is already compatible with libdap >= 3.10, no patch needed.
  * Still retaining chrpath trick to maintain compatibility against libtool 
    inner use in swing-enabled bindings.
  * Updated debian/watch file to cope with release-candidate versions which
    results newer than final ones.
  * Added symbol file to track changes in exported symbols from now on.
  * The -fvisibility=hidden has been removed.
  * Now linking uses a version script to include symbolic versions to all
    global symbols.
  * Added -Bsymbolic to force binding of global symbols to definition within
    the library. This should solve problems in linking against both tiff,
    geotiff and gdal. That should have no impact against netcdf, hdf5 and 
    other common formats.
    (closes: #558733)
  * Merged a lintian override from 1.7 series for TIFF library embedding.

  * Patch: symver. Added symbol versioning (GDAL_X.Y) for all symbols 
    exported by GDAL.
    (closes: #558733)
  * Patch: spatialite. Added explicit linking to sqlite3 for spatialite.
    This is Debian specific, because Debian spatialite does not embed Sqlite
    functions as in upstream release.
  * Merged with 1.7 series: added epsilon patch to fix now unsupported unnamed
    union use.
  * Versioned strict build-dependency on libepsilon.
  * Depends on libjpeg-dev.

    at clean time to be more nice against git-bp.
  * Added gdallocationinfo installation in gdal-bin.
  * Policy bumped to 3.9.2, no changes required.
  * Fixed manpages oddities.
    (closes: #615535)
  * Added some more cleanup instructions.
  * Now post-removing rpath in main library as well to avoid libtool tricks at

gdal (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, with a bounce of bugs fixing.
  * [PATCH] Added gdal-grass.dpatch to add VERSION to the grass plugin
    tarball. This is useful to force failing when a binNMU happens while
    GDAL is transitioning to a major version. See gdal-grass package to 
    understand  how it is managed. This trick does allow a proper fix
    of #544978.

gdal (1.6.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED.
  * Patch hdf5.dpatch renamed into hdf4.dpatch, sorry.
  * The mysql5.1.dpatch is a dirty trick to avoid FTBS due to MySQL 5.1 client
    lib headers which collide with g++ headers. This should be fixed at MySQL
    level, but at least it allows building.

gdal (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Francesco P. Lovergine ]

  The "doing-it-yourself-is-better" release.

  * New upstream release. 
    (closes: #370441)
    As stated previously, changed package name for
    a smooth C++ transition in case of (undocumented) API/ABI changes.
    Changed control and other files as consequence for 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 transition.
    - Patch revised:
    	libname.dpatch
    - Patches removed:
        351372_mipsel_ftbfs.dpatch (applied upstream)
        357189_gcc4.1_ftbfs.dpatch (idem)
        360389_amd64_ftbfs.dpatch  (better done by upstream)
    - New patch: 
    	ogrili2layer.cpp.dpatch (gcc 4.1 STL compatibility)
  * Policy bumped to 3.7.2. No changes.
  * Removed a couple of old *.docs and *.files files in debian dir.
  * Added mysql support.
  * Moved to new python policy. Note that python-gdal provides both modules 
    and an extension, so quite a few changes are required all around.
    See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPython/NewPolicy for information about
    the matter.

    to all interested parties or proper mass bug filling...

  [ Steve Halasz ]
  * Switch to team maintenance by the Debian GIS Project.
    This is _not_ hijacking, Silke is no more active on this package
    and passed the package to the team.
  * New upstream release
    - Don't crash on shapefiles without features (Closes: #309165)
  * Build-dep on libpq-dev | postgresql-dev for postgresql transition
  * Remove build-dep on postgresql-client
  * Make libgdal-dev depend on a number of -dev packages so that
    packages depending on libgdal-dev don't have to depend on them
  * Change library package names to libgdal1-1.3.1 / libgdal1-1.3.1-dev
    to reflect C++ ABI change that will be expected with every new
    version. The C API is stable (SONAME 1), but unfortunately both
    C and C++ API are merged in the same library by upstream.
    See http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-grass-general/2005-December/001565.html
    for a few details about the C++ API and ABI saga.

  [ Paul Wise ]

  * Change the upstream version definition to $(version)+$(cvsdate).
