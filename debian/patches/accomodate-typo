 Polygon cutlines may be used as a mask to restrict the area of the destination file that may be updated, including blending. If the OGR layer containing the cutline features has no explicit SRS, the cutline features must be in the georeferenced units of the destination file. When outputing to a not yet existing target dataset, its extent will be the one of the original raster unless -te or -crop_to_cutline are specified.
