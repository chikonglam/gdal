gdal (1.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

   Starting from this version GDAL follows the regular SONAME of the C API
   interface which has to be considered the only officially supported.
   The library still exports C++ symbols but the Debian package has introduced
   symbol files and symbol versioning in order to track changes and possibly
   introduce ad hoc patches whenever requiredi, in order to minimize the number
   of manual rebuilds of reverse dependencies. The good side effect of
   versioning script is that all symbols exported by the library which are
   not part of the GDAL/OGR API set are now definitively hidden.
   The use of symbol versioning could possibly introduce breakages against
   third parties binaries not built against the Debian version. Be warned.

gdal (1.5.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

   GDAL deprecated the old-style Python binding starting from 1.5 branch, so
   it has been dropped in Debian. Generally you should not experience big
   problems, because almost all API functions are supported by the new
   Swig-based binding. If not, consider that you need to upgrade to the 
   current interface.
   The old bindings use Numeric, the new SWIG-based use NumPy, for all
   the rest refer to GDAL documentation.
