	Standalone MrSID Drivers for GDAL
	===================================

This package contains standalone drivers for MrSID raster files that      
can be built after GDAL has been built and installed as an "autoload"   
driver.                                                                 

The purpose of this code is allowing a separate building of the MrSID
driver which is problematic for implied LIZARDTECH COMPUTER SOFTWARE
LICENSE. Note that in order to use GDAL (and GDAL-based third parties
product) along with LizardTech DSDK you need to read, understand and
approve the LizardTech DSDK license which can be retrieved on the
LizardTech site.


To build this driver it is necessary for it to find GDAL and MrSID support
files. Typically the configure and build process would look something
like:

./configure --with-gdal=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config \
            --with-mrsid=/usr/local/GeoDSDK-7.0    \
            --with-jp2mrsid=yes
            --with-geotiff=[yes or path]  
make
sudo make install

The GeoDSDK-7.0 directory will contain the required includes and libraries distributed 
by LizardTech.
